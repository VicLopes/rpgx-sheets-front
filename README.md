<h1 align="center">RPGX RPG Sheet Manager</h1>

## Purpose
RPGX is a primarily amateur project for the sake of managing TTRPG (Tabletop Roleplaying Games) character sheets, done by request of a friend.

It does not plan on being extremely comprehensive or malleable at first, and serves only as a cheaper substitute for more well-established alternatives. 

## How to use it

Host the [back-end repo](https://github.com/VicLopes/rpgx-sheets-back) and connect to it by  changing the apiURL on src/App.js

Run `yarn` to download & install dependencies

Run `yarn start` to start the server
